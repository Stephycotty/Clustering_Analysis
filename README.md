# Clustering_Analysis
### Clustering Analysis on Country Data

**Task Objective**:
This project applied machine learning clustering algorithms to the dataset `country_data.csv`, containing various indicators such as child mortality, exports,health,etc. The goal is to investigate and analyze the dataset using clustering techniques, derive meaningful insights, and provide recommendations based on the clustering results.

**Process and Methods**:

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: I imported the dataset into the working environment, handled missing values, and normalized features to ensure fair clustering results.

- **Feature Selection**: I included as many relevant features as possible to provide a comprehensive analysis and evaluated the impact of different feature combinations on clustering results.

- **Clustering Algorithms**: I applied K-means clustering to partition the countries into distinct clusters based on the selected features. Additionally,I used Mean Shift clustering to identify clusters without predefining the number of clusters, allowing the data to define the cluster structure naturally.

- **Visualization and Analysis**:I visualized the clusters using scatter plots to understand the distribution and characteristics of each cluster.I analyzed the results to draw conclusions about the similarities and differences between the countries within each cluster.

**Achievements**:
I successfully identified distinct clusters of countries based on multiple socioeconomic indicators, provided visualizations that clearly depict the clustering results, and derived actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders based on the analysis.
